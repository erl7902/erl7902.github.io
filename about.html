    <h2>Skills</h2>
    Python and C# are my most comfortable languages, but I have worked in a wide
    variety: Java, C, PHP, Haskell, SML/NJ, JavaScript, SQL
    (PostgreSQL and MicrosoftSQL), HTML, and CSS. <br><br>
    In my most recent technical role at RIT, I have been working in PHP with the
    laravel and eloquent frameworks, with some javascript/CSS work.
    <br><br>
    In python, I have worked extensively with
    Django, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, and pandas.
    <br><br>
    C# I used for back-end and API work while interning at Blackbaud,
    and became comfortable working with several Microsoft products alongside it:
    MicrosoftSQL, ASP.NET, and Azure.
    <br><br>
    While at Liberty Mutual, I leveraged PowerBI for data visualization
    of internal metrics to improve productivity across software development teams.

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>Attended RIT from 2013 to 2019, obtained a dual BS/MS in CS.
       During my master's I took advanced classes in ML and AI, language theory,
       and big data management. My thesis was on natural language processing -
       understanding moderation of online scientific discourse - and was published in
       <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8923109" target="_blank">WNYISPW 2019</a>.
    </p>

    <h2> Experience</h2>

    <p>
      I am currently a full stack web developer at the
      <a href="https://cad.rit.edu/" target="_blank">College of Art and Design at RIT</a>,
      where I have been working since July 2023. My team's main responsibilities include
      supporting the software for their inventory/asset management system, which is crucial
      for the students, faculty, and staff in the department. We also host and manage servers for
      students to create online portfolios to showcase their work.

    <p>
    After discovering a nearly-vegan establishment was for sale in Salem, MA, I
    decided to purchase <a href="https://jodibeebakes.com" target='_blank'>Jodi Bee Bakes</a>.
    I quickly learned how to manage a staff of up to 10 people during the busy season; I coordinated
    scheduling, purchasing, and customer orders. Unfortunately I had to shut down the business
    during the summer of 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
    I started working at <a href="https://libertymutualgroup.com" target="_blank">Liberty Mutual</a>
    in August 2020, working as a data analyst
    and engineer in the Corporate Functions group. My main responsibilities are
    data vizualisation in PowerBI, and creating pipelines for ETL work. We analyze
    internal metrics on productivity and project progress, and give recommendations
    on products and development methods to improve productivity and satisfaction
    for the technical staff.
    </p>

    <p>
    I was a Data Engineer at
    <a href='https://smartvid.io' target="_blank">Smartvid.io</a> for eight months from
    August 2019 to April 2020.
    I worked mostly in Python (Django and Jupyter notebook) and PostgreSQL to
    create data pipelines and perform ETL work. I cleaned and prepared data for
    <a href="https://pasc.ai/" target="_blank">PASC</a>, a council with the goal of providing
    a large pool of safety data from construction sites across many companies,
    allowing for a deeper analysis and to help avoid overfitting the specifics of
    any individual company.
    </p>

    <p>
      During college, I obtained over a year of internship experience working
      at various companies over the course of my education:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Blackbaud (2017):</b> fall co-op working on data lake and ML work;
          majority done in Azure and Jupyter notebooks.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Mozilla:</b> summer 2017 internship working on the Servo team.
        Created a prototype dataset and pipeline for the eventual creation of
        an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04879" target="_blank">interstitial ad detector</a>.
        Written in python with scikit-learn and selenium.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>Blackbaud (2016):</b> six month internship as a back end engineer,
          working on the API for <a href="fenxt.blackbaud.com" target="_blank">Financial Edge NXT</a>.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>CAIR @ RIT: </b> summer 2015 internship working at the
          <a href="cair.rit.edu">CAIR lab</a> within RIT. Worked on a team of web developers
          to create a <a href="https://github.com/RITAccess/Glance-data-analyzer" target="_blank">
            fully accessible website</a> to assist students in middle
          school math classes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      I also have "Enforced" for <a href="https://www.paxsite.com/" target="_blank">PAX</a> for four years
      (nine shows!), and now manage a team of fellow Enforcers to run panels,
      manage lines, and provide support to attendees.
      <br><br>
      In my spare time, I moderate several large subreddits on
      <a href="https://reddit.com" target="_blank">reddit</a> and have been cleaning internet trash
      since 2016 :)


    <h2> Interests </h2>
    <p>

      <br>
      Personal interests include: wine, rock climbing, and
