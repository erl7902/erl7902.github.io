    <h2>Skills</h2>
    Python and C# are my most comfortable languages, but I have worked in a wide
    variety: Java, C, Haskell, SML/NJ, JavaScript, SQL
    (PostgreSQL and MicrosoftSQL), HTML, and CSS. <br><br>
    In python, I have worked extensively with
    Django, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, and pandas.
    <br><br>
    C# I used for back-end and API work while interning at Blackbaud,
    and became comfortable working with several Microsoft products alongside it:
    MicrosoftSQL, ASP.NET, and Azure.

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>Attended RIT from 2013 to 2019, obtained a dual BS/MS in CS.
       During my master's I took advanced classes in ML and AI, language theory,
       and big data management. My thesis was on natural language processing -
       understanding moderation of online scientific discourse - and was published in
       <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8923109">WNYISPW 2019</a>.
    </p>

    <h2> Experience</h2>
    <p>
    Most recently, I was a Data Engineer at
    <a href='https://smartvid.io'>Smartvid.io</a> for eight months, until I was
    laid off due to COVID in April 2020.
    I worked mostly in Python (Django and Jupyter notebook) and PostgreSQL to
    create data pipelines and perform ETL work. I cleaned and prepared data for
    <a href="https://pasc.ai/">PASC</a>, a council with the goal of providing
    a large pool of safety data from construction sites across many companies,
    allowing for a deeper analysis and to help avoid overfitting the specifics of
    any individual company.
    </p>

    <p>
      During college, I obtained over a year of internship experience working
      at various companies over the course of my education:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Blackbaud (2017):</b> fall co-op working on data lake and ML work;
          majority done in Azure and Jupyter notebooks.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Mozilla:</b> summer 2017 internship working on the Servo team.
        Created a prototype dataset and pipeline for the eventual creation of
        an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04879">interstitial ad detector</a>.
        Written in python with scikit-learn and selenium.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>Blackbaud (2016):</b> six month internship as a back end engineer,
          working on the API for <a href="fenxt.blackbaud.com">Financial Edge NXT</a>.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>CAIR @ RIT: </b> summer 2015 internship working at the
          <a href="cair.rit.edu">CAIR lab</a> within RIT. Worked on a team of web developers
          to create a <a href="https://github.com/RITAccess/Glance-data-analyzer">
            fully accessible website</a> to assist students in middle
          school math classes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      I also have "Enforced" for <a href="paxsite.com">PAX</a> for four years
      (nine shows!), and now manage a team of fellow Enforcers to run panels.

    <h2> Interests </h2>
    <p>
      Professional interests include: Ethics in AI, NLP, and language theory
      <br>
      Personal interests include: veganism, rock climbing, and
